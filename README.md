# ASCII Player Reborn

Based on my past [ASCII-PLAYER](https://github.com/Azrielx86/ASCII-PLAYER) project.

This version gets every frame with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), converts it to ASCII and print it on terminal in real time, wihtout needing a helper file like in the past version.

Also for this version [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/) are used for the audio playback!
